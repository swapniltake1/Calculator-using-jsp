# Description 
<h3> This project is a simple calculator web application built using JavaServer Pages (JSP) that demonstrates error handling techniques in web development.</h3>
<p>
The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It takes two input values from the user and displays the result on the screen.



However, the application also includes robust error handling to prevent invalid inputs and unexpected errors from crashing the program. For example, the application checks that the user inputs are valid numbers and that the operation selected is valid before attempting to perform the calculation.



If an error occurs, the application gracefully displays an error message on the screen, informing the user of what went wrong and how to correct it.



This project can serve as a useful example for developers who are learning how to handle errors in web applications using JSP. The code is available on GitHub, and the README file provides instructions for running the application and an overview of the error handling techniques used.
